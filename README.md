# MelodyMine

Download music from Bilibili, YouTube, and Spotify URLs with automatic search, audio conversion, metadata cleanup, and zero-config dependency setup.

MelodyMine runs as a standalone CLI or as a file-based skill for AI assistants — WorkBuddy, Hermes, and OpenClaw. It auto-detects each platform's bundled Python runtime (WorkBuddy/Hermes ship one; OpenClaw users install Python once), so first-run setup is a single command on any of them.

## Features

- Bilibili for Chinese music queries, using direct WBI search plus `yt-dlp`.
- YouTube for English and international music queries.
- Spotify URL downloads through spotDL.
- Automatic, zero-config setup: auto-detects the host assistant's Python runtime (WorkBuddy/Hermes bundled, uv-managed, or system), installs pip packages, and falls back to `imageio-ffmpeg` for ffmpeg.
- Shared dependency layer (`melodymine_common.py`) with a unified venv — dependencies install once and are reused across both helpers and every supported assistant.
- Metadata cleanup with title, artist, album, cover, and `Artist - Title` renaming.
- Proxy and cookies support for restricted networks or YouTube bot checks.

## Quick Start

From the repository or skill root:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py setup
python scripts/music_helper.py download "周杰伦 稻香"
python scripts/music_helper.py download "The Weeknd Blinding Lights"
```

The only hard prerequisite is Python 3.10+. `setup` installs the Python packages MelodyMine needs.

## Common Commands

Download a Chinese song. Auto mode prefers Bilibili:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "周杰伦 稻香"
```

Download an English song. Auto mode prefers YouTube:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "The Weeknd Blinding Lights"
```

Download from a Spotify URL:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "https://open.spotify.com/track/..."
```

Download from a NetEase URL (resolved to song name, then Bilibili/YouTube):

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "https://music.163.com/song?id=185809"
```

Download from a direct URL (YouTube / SoundCloud / Bandcamp):

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."
python scripts/music_helper.py download "https://soundcloud.com/artist/song"
python scripts/music_helper.py download "https://artist.bandcamp.com/track/song"
```

Search without downloading:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py search "周杰伦 稻香"
python scripts/music_helper.py search "The Weeknd" --platform youtube
```

Force a platform:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "周杰伦 稻香" --platform bilibili
python scripts/music_helper.py download "The Weeknd Blinding Lights" --platform youtube
```

Choose format, bitrate, output folder, or search result:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "周杰伦 稻香" --format flac --bitrate 320K
python scripts/music_helper.py download "稻香" --index 2
python scripts/music_helper.py download "Artist Song" --output "D:\Music"
```

Use a proxy for YouTube when direct access fails:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "The Weeknd Blinding Lights" --proxy socks5://HOST:PORT
```

Use cookies when YouTube asks for sign-in or bot confirmation:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "Artist Song" --cookies "D:\path\cookies.txt"
```

Check dependencies:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py check
```

## CLI Options

```text
python scripts/music_helper.py download "query" [options]

Options:
  --platform {auto,bilibili,youtube}  Default: auto
  --format {mp3,flac,m4a,opus,wav,vorbis}
  --output PATH
  --proxy URL                         e.g. socks5://host:port
  --cookies PATH                      cookies.txt for YouTube checks
  --bitrate RATE                      e.g. 320K
  --index N                           1-based search result index
  --no-thumbnail
  --no-metadata
  --dry-run                           Preview command without executing
  --json                              Machine-readable JSON output
```

## Platform Routing

| Input | Default Route | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chinese query | Bilibili | No proxy expected. Falls back to YouTube if needed. |
| English or non-Chinese query | YouTube | Try direct first; add proxy after network failure. |
| Spotify URL | spotDL | Auto-installs spotDL on first use if possible. |
| NetEase URL (`music.163.com`) | Resolved → Bilibili/YouTube | Song name extracted via NetEase API, then downloaded via the normal pipeline. |
| YouTube/SoundCloud/Bandcamp URL | yt-dlp direct | No search step — downloads the URL directly. YouTube may need `--proxy`. |

## Advanced Spotify Operations

Use `scripts/spotify_helper.py` for playlist sync, metadata-only saves, URL resolution, or metadata updates:

```bash
python scripts/spotify_helper.py sync "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/..." --save-file playlist.spotdl
python scripts/spotify_helper.py save "https://open.spotify.com/album/..." --save-file album.spotdl
python scripts/spotify_helper.py url "Artist - Song"
python scripts/spotify_helper.py meta "D:\Music\song.mp3"
```

See `references/usage.md` for spotDL option details and `references/config.md` for spotDL configuration fields.

## Install As An AI Skill

Copy this folder to your assistant's skills directory:

| Platform | Example path |
| --- | --- |
| WorkBuddy | `~/.workbuddy/skills/melodymine/` |
| OpenClaw | `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/melodymine/` |
| Hermes | `~/.hermes/skills/melodymine/` |
| Custom | Any directory your assistant scans for file-based skills |

> Runtime note: WorkBuddy and Hermes ship a bundled Python that MelodyMine auto-detects on first run. OpenClaw runs on Node.js and does **not** bundle Python, so OpenClaw users must install Python 3.10+ from python.org before first use — `setup` will then locate it.

Then restart the assistant and ask naturally:

```text
下载周杰伦的稻香
Download Blinding Lights by The Weeknd
下载这个 https://open.spotify.com/track/...
```

The assistant should read `SKILL.md`, run setup if needed, execute the download command, and report the saved path.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| No Python found | Install Python 3.10+ from python.org, then rerun setup. |
| Bilibili `412 Precondition Failed` | Retry after a few seconds; the helper already retries once. |
| YouTube timeout | Retry with `--proxy socks5://HOST:PORT` if you have a proxy. |
| YouTube asks for sign-in or bot confirmation | Export YouTube cookies to cookies.txt and pass `--cookies PATH`. |
| Spotify `KeyError: 'uri'` | Search by song name instead of Spotify URL, or use `spotify_helper.py --use-official-api` when appropriate. |
| Metadata is wrong | Retry with a more exact `Artist Song` query or add `--no-metadata`. |
