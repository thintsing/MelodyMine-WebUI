# MelodyMine

Use MelodyMine to execute music downloads directly. Do not only explain commands unless the user asks for explanation.

Assume commands run from the skill root directory unless the assistant platform provides a different skill path.

## First Run

On a new machine, run setup once before downloading:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py setup
```

If setup fails because Python is missing, ask the user to install Python 3.10+ and stop. The helper installs `yt-dlp`, `requests`, `pysocks`, `imageio-ffmpeg`, and locates ffmpeg automatically.

For later requests, use `check` only when dependency health is uncertain:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py check
```

## Choose The Command

Use `scripts/music_helper.py` for normal search and download:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "query"
python scripts/music_helper.py search "query"
```

Use `scripts/spotify_helper.py` only for advanced Spotify operations such as playlist sync, metadata-only save, URL resolution, or updating metadata:

```bash
python scripts/spotify_helper.py sync "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/..." --save-file playlist.spotdl
python scripts/spotify_helper.py save "https://open.spotify.com/album/..." --save-file album.spotdl
python scripts/spotify_helper.py meta "/path/to/song.mp3"
python scripts/spotify_helper.py meta "/path/to/song.mp3" --query "Artist - Song"
python scripts/spotify_helper.py url "Artist - Song"
```

You can also update metadata for any existing audio file with `music_helper.py meta`:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py meta "/path/to/song.mp3"
python scripts/music_helper.py meta "/path/to/song.mp3" --query "周杰伦 稻香"
```

Read `references/usage.md` only when the user needs advanced spotDL options. Read `references/config.md` only when editing or explaining spotDL configuration.

## Download Workflow

1. Extract the song, artist, album, playlist, URL, requested format, output path, proxy, and search-result index from the user request.
2. If this is the first MelodyMine use on the machine, run `setup` first. Otherwise `download` and `check` auto-ensure dependencies — no explicit `setup` needed.
3. Select platform:
   - Spotify URL: pass the URL to `music_helper.py download`.
   - NetEase URL (`music.163.com/song?id=xxx`): pass the URL to `music_helper.py download` — it resolves the song name first, then downloads via NetEase direct → Bilibili → YouTube.
   - Query containing Chinese characters: use auto mode, which prefers Soulseek → Bilibili → YouTube.
   - English or non-Chinese query: use auto mode, which prefers Soulseek → YouTube.
4. Add options requested by the user. If the user wants a fast download without Soulseek, add `--quick`.
5. Run the command.
6. Report the saved path, format, fallback tier, and any warning.

## Core Examples

Chinese song, default FLAC:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "周杰伦 稻香"
```

English song:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "The Weeknd Blinding Lights"
```

Spotify URL:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "https://open.spotify.com/track/..."
```

NetEase URL (resolved to song name, then downloaded via Bilibili/YouTube):

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "https://music.163.com/song?id=185809"
```

Direct URL (YouTube / SoundCloud / Bandcamp — yt-dlp downloads directly, no search):

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."
python scripts/music_helper.py download "https://soundcloud.com/artist/song"
python scripts/music_helper.py download "https://artist.bandcamp.com/track/song"
```

Force platform:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "周杰伦 稻香" --platform bilibili
python scripts/music_helper.py download "The Weeknd Blinding Lights" --platform youtube
```

Specify format, bitrate, output, or result index:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "周杰伦 稻香" --format flac --bitrate 320K
python scripts/music_helper.py download "稻香" --index 2
python scripts/music_helper.py download "Artist Song" --output "/path/to/music"
```

Use a proxy for YouTube when direct access fails:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "The Weeknd Blinding Lights" --proxy socks5://HOST:PORT
```

Use cookies when YouTube reports bot/sign-in checks:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "Artist Song" --cookies "/path/to/cookies.txt"
```

Force Soulseek (P2P) for hard-to-find songs or lossless FLAC:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "Air Supply Complete" --platform soulseek
```

Fast download — skip Soulseek, go straight to Bilibili/YouTube:

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py download "周杰伦 稻香" --quick
python scripts/music_helper.py download "The Weeknd Blinding Lights" --quick
```

Search Soulseek network only (no download):

```bash
python scripts/music_helper.py search "X Japan FLAC" --platform soulseek
```

> **Note**: Soulseek requires credentials. Set `SLSK_USERNAME` and `SLSK_PASSWORD` environment variables, or pass `--slsk-user USER --slsk-pass PASS`. Search returns results from all users; download auto-selects the best FLAC from a user with free slots.

## Options

`music_helper.py download` supports:

- `--platform {auto,bilibili,youtube,ytmusic,soulseek}`: default `auto`.
- `--format {auto,mp3,flac,m4a,opus,wav,vorbis}`: default `auto`. `auto` probes the source codec: flac if lossless (flac/alac/wav/pcm), else mp3 320K — no fake-lossless upcast.
- `--output PATH`: default platform music folder.
- `--proxy URL`: for YouTube or Spotify download networking.
- `--cookies PATH`: cookies.txt for YouTube bot/sign-in checks.
- `--bitrate RATE`: for example `320K` or `128K`.
- `--index N`: 1-based search result index.
- `--no-thumbnail`: skip cover embedding.
- `--no-metadata`: skip multi-source metadata lookup, ID3 cleanup, and file rename.
- `--dry-run`: print the command that would run without executing.
- `--json`: output machine-readable JSON (use with `--dry-run` or after a successful download).
- `--debug`: write a session log to `~/.melodymine/last_run.log` for troubleshooting.
- `--slsk-user USER`: Soulseek username (or set `SLSK_USERNAME` env var).
- `--slsk-pass PASS`: Soulseek password (or set `SLSK_PASSWORD` env var).
- `--quick`: skip Soulseek P2P tier — go straight to Bilibili/YouTube for faster downloads.

`music_helper.py meta "filepath"` supports:

- `--query QUERY`: search query for metadata lookup (default: derive from filename).
- `--no-thumbnail`: skip cover art embedding.
- `--json`: output machine-readable JSON after the update.

## Platform Behavior

| Input | Primary Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chinese query | Soulseek → Bilibili → YouTube | Soulseek first (lossless P2P, ~30s timeout), then Bilibili, then YouTube as last resort. Use `--quick` to skip Soulseek. |
| English/non-Chinese query | Soulseek → YouTube | Soulseek first, then YouTube. Use `--quick` to skip Soulseek. Add proxy only after network failure. |
| Spotify URL | spotDL through `music_helper.py` | May need proxy in restricted regions. For playlist sync use `spotify_helper.py`. |
| NetEase URL (`music.163.com/song?id=xxx`) | NetEase direct → Bilibili/YouTube | Resolves song name via NetEase API, tries NetEase CDN direct download first (free songs), falls back to Bilibili/YouTube. |
| YouTube/SoundCloud/Bandcamp URL | yt-dlp direct download | No search step — yt-dlp downloads the URL directly. YouTube may need proxy/cookies. |
| Force Soulseek (`--platform soulseek`) | Soulseek P2P network | ⚠️ Requires `SLSK_USERNAME` and `SLSK_PASSWORD` env vars. Downloads the best FLAC from the first user with free slots. |
| Force quick (`--quick`) | Bilibili or YouTube (skip Soulseek) | Skips the Soulseek P2P tier entirely. Useful when Soulseek is slow/unavailable or for faster downloads. |

## Error Handling

Execute the first matching row. Do not explain the table to the user — just run the recovery action and report the outcome.

| Symptom (match against stderr/output) | Recovery action (run this, don't just suggest it) |
| --- | --- |
| `412 Precondition Failed` during Bilibili download | The helper already retries once and falls back to Bilibili API direct, then YouTube. If all tiers failed, tell the user Bilibili is rate-limiting and retry the same command after 10s. |
| YouTube `timeout` / `unreachable` / connection refused | Ask the user for a proxy, then retry: `download "<query>" --proxy socks5://HOST:PORT`. Do not retry without a proxy if the first attempt already timed out. |
| YouTube `Sign in to confirm you're not a bot` | Ask the user to export cookies.txt (e.g. via "Get cookies.txt" browser extension for YouTube), then retry: `download "<query>" --cookies /path/cookies.txt`. |
| Spotify `KeyError: 'uri'` | Extract the track name from the Spotify URL or ask the user for it, then download by name instead: `download "Artist Song"`. Do not retry the same Spotify URL. |
| `No results` on any platform | Try: (1) `Artist Title` format, (2) force the other platform via `--platform`, (3) broaden the query. Try up to 2 variants before reporting failure to the user. |
| Soulseek `no results` | Ensure `SLSK_USERNAME` and `SLSK_PASSWORD` are set. Try a broader query with fewer words. |
| Soulseek `credentials not set` / `SLSK_USERNAME not set` | Ask the user to provide Soulseek credentials (set env vars `SLSK_USERNAME` and `SLSK_PASSWORD`, or pass `--slsk-user` `--slsk-pass`). If unavailable, retry with `--quick` to skip Soulseek. |
| Soulseek `download failed` / timeout | The remote user may be offline or have a full queue. Retry the same command — Soulseek picks a different result. |
| Download succeeds but `metadata is wrong` | Retry once with `--no-metadata` to at least fix the filename, then offer the user a manual retry with a more exact `Artist Song` query. For already-downloaded files, use `python scripts/music_helper.py meta "/path/to/song.mp3" --query "Artist Song"`. |
| `spotdl` not installed / install failed | Fall back to searching the song name via `download "Artist Song"` (Bilibili/YouTube path). Do not block on spotDL. |

General rules:
- If a recovery action needs information from the user (proxy, cookies, track name), ask once, then proceed.
- If the same error recurs after the recovery action, stop and report the raw error to the user — do not loop.
- Never silently retry the identical failing command more than twice.

## Reporting

After a successful command, tell the user:

- the downloaded song or source URL,
- the output directory or file path printed by the helper,
- the format,
- whether fallback, proxy, cookies, or metadata cleanup was used.

If the command fails, summarize the real error and the next concrete retry command.
